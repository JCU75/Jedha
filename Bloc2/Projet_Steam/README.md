<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/Steam_icon_logo.svg" alt="Steal logo" style="height: 100px; width:100px;"/>

The ultimate goal of this project is to understand what factors affect the popularity or sales of a video game. 

**Analysis at the "macro" level**
- Which publisher has released the most games on Steam?
- What are the best rated games?
- Are there years with more releases? Were there more or fewer game releases during the Covid, for example?
- How are the prizes distributed? Are there many games with a discount
- What are the most represented languages?
- Are there many games prohibited for children under 16/18?

**Genres analysis**
- What are the most represented genres?
- Are there any genres that have a better positive/negative review ratio?
- Do some publishers have favorite genres?
- What are the most lucrative genres?

**Platform analysis**
- Are most games available on Windows/Mac/Linux instead?
- Do certain genres tend to be preferentially available on certain platforms?
